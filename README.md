## Cloning and Running the Application in local

Clone the project into local
`git clone git@bitbucket.org:admin_dbo/mobile-salesman-service.git` to clone the project to your local environment. You can also download the project manually by choosing the `mobile-salesman-service` branch and download the `zip` file.

### Installation

1. npm install ( to install dependencies)
2. yarn

### Setup environments

The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new `envs` you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure `yarn [environment]`

DEV: `yarn dev`

STG: `yarn staging`

PROD: `yarn prod`

Modify the environment variables files in root folder (`.env.development`,`.env.staging` and `.env.production`)
